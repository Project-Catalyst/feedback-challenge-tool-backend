Only high-utility NFTs that have functionality within their own metaverse as well as cross-functionality with other metaverse projects will be considered for listing. This assures that only NFTs with strong secondary market potential are launched on our platform, protecting NFT purchasers, while building long-lasting economies for their projects.\n\nLaceUp listings are promoted, marketed, and shared with Lovelace's community of followers, previous sale participants as well as blockchain focused venture capital funds and high-net worth buyers. NFT buyers can participate to collect and/or participate within the issuers' ecosystem and metaverse. We expect a very diverse array of projects from games, collectibles, high-quality artwork with built-in economies to decentralized applications, and infrastructure projects.\n\n**The LaceUp launchpad ecosystem consists of two primary participants:**\n\n***Project and NFT Issuer***\n\nProjects work closely with the Lovelace team to conceptualize, create, and issue their NFTs on LaceUp. NFTs sales may be linked to airdropped project tokens, unlock special functionality, enhance gaming, provide gamified yields, and/or provide unique experiences to their holders.\n\n***NFT Purchaser***\n\nNFT Purchasers buy NFTs listed on LaceUp and hold them within their wallets to gain access to airdropped tokens, unlock special functionality, earn gamified yields and/or receive unique experiences within a projects metaverse.\n\nThe LaceUp launchpad serves as a destination for the release of both third-party developed as well as in-house Lovelace projects.\n\n  \n\n**LEARN MORE ABOUT LOVELACE WORLD**\n\n**Website and Social Media:**\n\nWebsite: https://lovelace.world/\n\nTwitter (83k+ followers): https://twitter.com/LovelaceWorld\n\nDiscord (12k+ followers): https://discord.com/invite/6w49dSAd5M\n\nTelegram (32k+ followers): https://t.me/lovelaceofficial\n\n**Select Media Coverage:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P4yWlvV9PI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLrZ0B81vjg\n\nThank you for your consideration!

Several of these \"ghosts\" are extremely dedicated and talented people, but they need and deserve greater reach and support in the community.\n\nSince Shelley's launch, one of the issues that has created long and fruitless debates has been about the sustainability and the difficulty of small SPOs raise delegation versus large pool groups (like Binance), SPOs with multi-pools (like 1PCT) and SPOs influencers (I won't quote them, but you know who they are). I want to make it clear that this is all in the rules of the game, but it doesn't mean that it is good for decentralization.\n\nWe know that the K parameter and pledge are important for defining the theoretical number of SPOs, but marketing capacity and social outreach distort the playing field, harming and overshadowing small SPOs.\n\nHow can we level the playing field with sustainable, rational and aove all, free market incentives?\n\nFurthermore, Catalyst has been an amazing funding option for developers in the Cardano community, but the 3-month cycle of each Fund can dampen innovation. Some projects need quick funding sources. Some projects could be funded by the community itself. Not every good proposal fits a challenge. There is demand for alternative funding models for developers and builders, so why not create space for them outside Catalyst regular 3 month cycle funding?\n\nEach team can request up to 20% of the total $300,000 USD budget\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $30,000 USD\n\nTeam B with 4 proposals of $15,000 USD\n\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $60,000 USD\n\nTeam D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $45,000 USD\n\nThe idea of limiting a team to requesting up to 25% of the budget is to allow for a greater diversity of ideas and approaches to solving the problem.  \n\nIt is important to note that 20% is the maximum, any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 5 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\nDue to the urgency of the issue related to the frequent retirement of several small SPOs and the difficulty in increasing the viability/profitability of small SPOs/developers I believe the budget would be appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, at Fund7 we had two challenges funded related to SPOs and there is a good demand for proposals in these challenges..\n\nPotential Directions\n\n*   Marketing teams to promote small SPOs\n*   Alternative Reward Models (FISO, NFT aidrops)\n*   Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms\n*   Creating advanced filters for selecting small SPOs\n*   Multi delegation research\n*   Explorers and adaptation of wallets to build multi delegation portfolios\n\nIn this video Sebastien Guillemot( Former co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo and dcSpark CTO and co founder) explains the importance of pools distribution(consensus distribution) to increase reliability and assurances for users and dapps on the blockchain:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=xwlN3DZvmgQ&feature=emb_logo", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Small SPOs and developers have more options, services and tools to get delegates and funding + Greater distribution in block minting.", "importance": "To achieve greater decentralization and resilience in the blockchain through sustainability/feasibility for small SPOs and devs."}, {"id": 384803, "category": 26257, "comments_count": 9, "title": "Boosting Diversity in Catalyst", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/384803-48088", "description": "As a community, how can we increase diversity and bring new people and communities into Project Catalyst?", "author": "bridgebuilders", "requested_funds": "300000", "challenge_brief": "Diversity leads to increased creativity and better outcomes in every instance where it has been studied and measured.

May people get turn off by investing, so most people would not actually learn about cardano until they are an investor because it is still under \"crypto\" to the general public.\n\nI think when cardano is able to introduce more hardware that people will buy and use, then the story will start to change significantly because it's not longer just \"crypto\" and speculation.\n\nFor example, There are likely many craftsmen that make awesome knifes in the cardano network. There should be a way for that person to brand their knifes under cardano. In order to brand it under cardano, there needs to be some level of standards to ensure high quality hardware products. Kinda like Michelin Stars for restaurants. We can have levels of quality on hardware that have been verified by the cardano's advisor that focuses on ensuring high quality products.\n\nI think this is also a very important macro trend because one of the biggest issues we have today is that people are buying a lot of cheap and low quality product that does not last. This is not a great use of resource, and it also cost consumers more money over time. People used to old very high-quality products over a very long time, but things have changed since. I think cardano can help make the shift to make people start wanting to own more high quality products.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I've been designing hardware for the last 6 years now for spacex, and now i really want to start designing things for the open source world so more people can enjoy awesome open source products. Having a way to enable this will take a lot of the hardware engineering resources from centralized hard corporations into the decentralized world. So whatever is designed is no longer own by large companies that takes a large amount of the value, and allow that value get pass back down to the engineer or consumers.

There's a lot of ongoing interest in connecting Cardano to the real world... and countless proposals relating to this broad area in past rounds have been approved by vote but then unable to be funded for lack of funds. So we need a challenge topic fund to address these directly.\n\nWhether it's about talking to the real world via IOT control, or listening to the real world via oracles and related technologies, or representing\u00a0the real world in a liquid form by securitizing assets, they all have one thing in common: robustly moving information back and forth between the chain and the real world. But so far most approaches to getting information on and off the chain rely on old-world thinking. Some authority must be empowered to act as an interface, whether it's an oracle or a securities broker or an IOT gateway. Imagine how much better we could do! Crypto hardware embedded in physical endpoints could make the chain aware of each individual item of interest for sensing, control, or trade. Trusted verification could be implemented in a decentralized way using cleverly designed stake pool contracts. And who knows how many more innovations will appear over time?\n\nThe first big decentralized ledger system was only an accounting and value exchange system. But most of the innovations since then have embraced the broader vision of bringing the benefits of DLT to the entire world of potential computing applications:\u00a0decentralization, individual sovereignty, efficiency, and trust, without compromising one for the other. This challenge setting proposal will ensure that the Cardano ecosystem stays at the forefront.\n\n**EXAMPLE SCENARIO**\n\nThe enormous boom in NFT trade shows how much interest there is in using DLT to securitize and trade non-cash assets. This boom has taken place despite the limitations of current NFTs, particularly the concern that there's no guarantee that the purchaser is getting ownership of an artwork\u2014or ownership of anything at all, for that matter.\n\nIf NFTs could securely, verifiably represent real ownership of arbitrary physical goods it would open up the possibility of nearly all commodities markets becoming accessible to blockchain-based trading, while undermining the power and dominance of the entrenched financial institutions that currently control all commodities and securities trades.\u00a0\n\nBut in order for this revolution in decentralization and empowerment to take place, the technology must be created to allow it. A successful system will have to combine technical elements such as low-cost embedded cryptographic hardware, considerations of game theory and economics, as well as clever development of contracts and trading/minting policies, in order to answer questions like:\n\n\\-Who is responsible for validating or certifying a token (etc.) that represents a particular good or asset?\n\n\\-Why can they be trusted? What are the incentives?\n\n\\-How can a certified token (etc.) be independently cross-checked? What information must be transparent?\n\n\\-Are there punitive incentives, or just positive? By what mechanism are they imposed?\n\n**RATIONALE FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION**\n\nTo encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to $62,500 USD (25%) of the total $250,000 USD total budget.\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $31,250 USD\n\nTeam B with 1 proposal of $62,500 USD\n\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $40,000 USD + 1 proposal of $22,500 USD\n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\n**CONTACT INFO**\n\nIf you would like to know more please feel free to reach out to me at:\n\ndavid@carbonno.org\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmperlman/  \n\n**THEME SONG**\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IO to the world, Cardano's here\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let earth receive blockchain!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let every Dapp\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Receive and send\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Data from everything,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And data to everything,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And token, and tokenize everything.\n\nSee attachment for sheet music!", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Cardano gets more oracles, more IOT, and more assets tokenized on-chain: real estate, commodities, music, forests, carbon credits, patents\u2026", "importance": "Numerous proposals in this area have appeared in the past.

Let's be serious about seeding long term projects in Africa to capture a large share of an important emerging market.\n\n++Rationale for budget++\n\nLet's be frank here. We need much more than 250k to continue seeding Cardano in Africa. We are asking for this amount because of Catalyst voting patterns; in that $250k is better than $0 and Wada and Partners can still take advantage of other challenge categories to help expand Cardano in Africa.", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Cardano is the blockchain of choice in Africa by 2023.\n\nProjects and developers\u00a0in Africa will not be isolated, but networked and growing.", "importance": "The 'Grow Africa' challenge is central to a key initiative of Cardano's, expanding into Africa.

It has a large and young population of more than 80M people. It is the home of one of the earliest cryptocurrency exchanges, BTCTurk, which was founded in 2013. As such, Turkish people have been some of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Triple A research, ~2.4M of the populace own cryptocurrencies. This makes it the nation with the 19th most cryptocurrency users \\[1\\]. This however does not capture the entire picture as the growth of this number has been 10 fold in the past year \\[2\\]. This massive growth can most directly be attributed to rising prices of cryptocurrencies and to the speedy devaluation of the Turkish Lira (around ~40% against the US Dollar in 2021).\u00a0\n\nDevaluation of the currency has gotten exceedingly worse and is set to continue in the near future. The negative effects are felt throughout the country as wages tumble on a USD basis. Minimum wage is around $220 as of the time of this proposal (nearly half the working population earn min. wage), meaning any funds put to work in Turkey can get lots of involvement from the local population.\u00a0  \n\nDespite this growth, Cardano adoption is very low. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no broader Cardano community. Majority of the investors in the trading group were drawn to ADA by the performance of the cryptocurrency. As a result, trader emotions like fear and greed dominate the conversation within cryptocurrency communities, resulting in misinformation about the broader Cardano community. As such, a Turkish Cardano community is sorely needed to raise awareness of the vision of Cardano beyond the token price.\n\nWe the proposers of this challenge are trying to do so and bring more qualified Turkish people into the Cardano community. However, we are just a group of three within Project Catalyst with a broader network of around 20 that are involved in cryptocurrencies in Turkey. If the real value of Cardano can be demonstrated in Turkey, this number will dramatically increase. This is especially true given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects. However, they face language obstacles and lack some of the relevant competencies. Therefore more initiatives are needed to realize the potential of Turkey and to aid the global adoption of Cardano.\n\nGiven these points, what could Turkey offer the Cardano community back in return? Turkey has great potential in its qualified IT and cybersecurity personnel built thanks in part to a solid financial services sector. It also has a large pool of young, active and forward looking individuals, looking to contribute to their communities. This challenge aims to bring this potential to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n**Guiding questions**\n\n*   How can we involve general ADA holders in project Catalyst in Turkey?\n*   How can we increase number of SPOs from Turkey?\n*   How can we increase more meaningful participation from Turkey?\n*   How can we encourage new members to utilize the tools and services available for onboarding?\n*   How can we localize the existing materials?\n\n**Challange Team**\n\n**Cem Karaca**\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca\n\n**\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ya\u015far Akyar**\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar/\n\n**\u00c7a\u011fkan Acarbay**\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fkan-acarbay-b2210b136/\n\n**References**\n\n\\[1\\] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-turkey/.\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/paribu-has-published-the-results-of-the-most-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-survey-cryptocurrency-use-in-turkey-has-increased-by-10-times/", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Motivated community of developers, SPOs, stakers, voters, challange teams collaborating for the growth of Cardano from Turkey in 2023.", "importance": "Decentralisation and resilience of Cardano is based on the inclusion of different locations including those communities not involved."}, {"id": 383995, "category": 26257, "comments_count": 0, "title": "Catalyst Accelerator & Mentors", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/383995-48088", "description": "How can Catalyst harness professional firepower to bootstrap an accelerator environment that amplifies and commercializes funded projects?", "author": "catalystadmin", "requested_funds": "500000", "challenge_brief": "Startup innovation and co-creation is the lifeblood of Cardano.

Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.\n\nWith this access, you'll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry.

In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.\n\n**++Areas of Focus++**\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nMost digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.\n\nThe best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.\n\nWe encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.\n\n**Self-governance of Emergent Communities**\n\n++DAO Governance in Practice++\n\nNew legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.\n\nWe are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.\n\nThe proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.\n\n++Patterns of Commoning++\n\nWe draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from 'Patterns of Commoning.' We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.\n\nHow can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?\n\nWe are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.\n\n++Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives++\n\nMany of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.\n\nWe need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:\n\n*   For onboarding new experts and teachers\n*   For people in the community to develop and grow\n*   For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.\n\nWhen reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.\n\n**Circular Supply Chain**\n\nThe global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.\n\nSupply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:\n\n*   Regenerative agriculture\n*   Locally produced art\n*   Other forms of local commerce\n\nOn the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.\n\nFor the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:\n\n++Small Producer Problem++\n\nHow can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?\n\nFor example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.\n\nThere are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:\n\n*   Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains\n*   Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.\n\n++The Last-Mile Problem++\n\nHow can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?\n\nThis challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We're looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.\n\nAn example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.\n\nHowever, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.\n\nAddressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.\n\n**++A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)++**\n\n**Primitives**\n\n*   Digital Identity\n*   Verifiable Credential (VC)\n*   Verifiable Presentation Request\n*   Verifiable Presentation Proof\n*   Cryptocurrency\n*   Non-fungible token (NFT)\n*   Smart contract\n\n**Patterns**\n\n*   Trust Registry\n*   Governance Framework\n*   Token Curated Registry\n*   Community member recognition and onboarding process\n*   Establishing Individual Reputation\n*   Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party\n*   Community member as an individual interaction with an external party\n*   Community medium of exchange\n*   Recognition of external Trust Registry\n*   Recognition of external Governance Framework\n*   Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party\n\nWith that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:\n\n1.

It was artists who for instance, turned the field of optics and light-sensitive materials to the engine of photography and film. Like many STEM fields, the blockchain community has thus far not been welcoming to the insights provided by artists. We do enable a level of independence from traditional king-makers of the art world through NFTs but at the end of the day, NFTs have become a financial product, above all else making artworks easier to speculate on.\n\nWe have created a new mode of human communication and organization but have largely handed it to the finance industry; And in doing so, we have alienated a community of creatives who could tell us novel things about this new mode of human connection, further expanding its historical role.

Moreover*, there is no *common infrastructure* that the projects can use to *track issues*, and *publish* basic *public information* about the ++*projects funded by the community*++.\n\nWe are of the advise that *we need a set of standards, processes, and infrastructures to be used by the Cardano open source projects*, such that (1) The teams of different O.S. projects\u00a0can easily *collaborate*; (2) New-joiners can easily *discover*, *understand*, *test*, and *contribute* to existing O.S. projects; (3) Cardano O.S. projects can access a pool of basic *infrastructures* and *tools* that are needed.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nAs mentioned by Charles Hoskinson \\[1\\] \"Cardano code is Open Source, but needs to be managed like a true open source project, like Linux and other O.S. projects \\[..\\]\".\u00a0\n\n\\[1\\]\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T88_XKzi8ms&t=492s\n\nIn order to proceed in this direction, we need to use\u00a0*Catalyst as a governance over a true, vendor-neutral open source and open-standards ecosystem*.

Limiting other greenhouse gases and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate\"\n\n**Guiding questions**\n\n*   What will have the greatest impact on climate change in the short and long term?\n*   What real-world regenerative solutions already exist that would benefit from applications developed on the Cardano blockchain now, and in the near future?\n*   How can we incentivize individuals, local communities, councils and municipal authorities, businesses and governments to prioritize taking action to reduce our overall carbon footprint?\n*   What are the most useful and scalable applications to put Cardano at the forefront of real, actionable solutions which reduce the greenhouse gases we will pass on to future generations?\n*   How can we minimize Cardanos CO2 emissions further or even become Climate positive?\n\n**Proposal success metrics:**\n\n*   How big is the impact on Cardanos self-sustainability?\n*   How big is the impact on Co2 emissions?\n*   How big is the impact on regenerating our planet?\n*   How big is the awareness that will be created?\n*   Is your proposal financially sustainable after funding?\n\n  \n\n**Budget rationale**\n\nWhen looking for a budget we thought about, how much of our focus should lie on solving this issue from within the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem. We believe that 1 Million for a first Climate Change Challenge would have been too much since we are a blockchain Fund and not an environmental Fund, but we also believe that there is potential and therefore 3-4% of the Funding seemed reasonable to us.\n\n  \n\n**Links**\n\nJoin our Community!\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Cardano4Climate\n\nPress release on IPCC-report:\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/\u00a0  \n\n  \n\n**References**\n\n*   \\[1\\] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w89O_6R-sqd9WmCTttdaUtwAenckJlZt1nJT2LmatQY/edit#gid=0\n*   \\[2\\] https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/jqqjqsyccqbtb/\n*   \\[3\\] https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/\n\n  \n\n**++This is a challenge setting proposal++**", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Climate Change impact has been significantly reduced by successfully nurturing and completing Catalyst Projects now and in the future.", "importance": "Legacy systems have failed us on climate change!

Initially, the majority of its budget was destined to the Developer Ecosystem. For instance, in Fund 6, the Developer Ecosystem was assigned 1 mil. USD, that was 25% of the total 4 mil. available for the Fund.\n\nIn Fund 7, Catalyst released control of the budget to the community, which was able to choose the destination of the funding through voting. Unfortunately, the Developer Ecosystem challenge proposed for F7 was rejected because it did not receive enough votes. This led to the lack of an important resource stream that could have been used for the development of the Cardano technology.\n\n**The Open Source Development Ecosystem Challenge**\n\nThe OSDE challenge aims to provide a stream of resources to teams that want to develop their projects and contribute back to the community by sharing part of their efforts in terms of open source projects, open-source frameworks, and accessible knowledge.\n\nThe main idea is that *projects funded by the community* can both *generate business value* retained by the teams, *and* at the same time *contribute back to the community*\u00a0by improving the ecosystem itself.\n\nFor example, a team can be funded to develop a project; *generate business value* by leveraging a profitable idea, and *share the non-core-business* part of their work in terms of *shared knowledge* or in terms of *building frameworks or projects* with other teams - such that is possible *to solve complex problems by joining minds and dividing the efforts across different teams*.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCatalyst exists to gradually work towards the final stage of the roadmap of Cardano: Voltaire. We are building tools to *support new forms of governance and collaboration, on top of technology that is still being developed*. The development of this technology itself, in the end, will have to become part of this same process as well. Such a complex and daunting task requires experts from a variety of disciplines to work together with a common goal.\n\n**Guiding questions:**\n\n*   How can we ensure future efforts benefit from the work that is funded today?\n*   How do we align between different open source community efforts?\n*   What are the next steps to fuse IOG development with the community?\n*   How can we encourage experts to collaborate and share their knowledge and work?\n*   How can we develop a sustainable ecosystem while sharing knowledge and efforts?\n\n**Possible directions:**\n\n*   Education for development in the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystem\n*   Developing common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, or proof of concepts\n*   Incentive systems for development & hosting\n*   Common audited repositories & overviews of existing solutions\n*   Organizing events to bring the development ecosystem together\n*   Collaboration to improve interoperability within the ecosystem\u00a0\n\n  \n\n***Note***\n\nFor a challenge with this budget and these aspirations, it is essential to have a *broad consensus*. If that support is present, then the results will be owned by the same ecosystem that supports its development.\u00a0\n\n***Complimentary Challenges***\n\nThis challenge is about growing the open-source ecosystem by funding and improving projects that should share part of their efforts to make the ecosystem grow, and it is *not to be confused* with:\n\n*   The Developer Ecosystem Challenge \\[1 mil\\](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Developer-Ecosystem/384822-48088) that focus on developer ecosystem not necessarily open source.\n*   The Open Standards & Interoperability Challenge \\[500k\\](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Standards-Interoperability/383619-48088) that aims to establish standards, processes, and foster interoperability.\u00a0\n\nWe have aligned our efforts with these other challenges and aligned our budgets. We feel there is space for all three. Many open source projects start out as closed source and many contributors to open source projects started out as people using the open source as part of their own private project. We feel that having both is would lead to the best of both worlds.

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community's support and build on or use the Cardano network.\n\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\n\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\n\nCardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let's build upon that.\n\nWhat this is:\n\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\n\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\n\nIt is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement.

By collecting user experiences in reputation profiles, participants are encouraged to interact more with well-behaving peers hence better online behavior is motivated.  \n\n  \n\nCreating a transparent and comprehensible reputation system that will increase trust in order set the base for growing adoption of Cardano in general through practical use cases - and in Project Catalyst for proposers, voters, (veteran) community advisors.\n\n**Why is it important (extended):**\n\nProject Catalyst attracts new community members from fund to fund. To grow even more and, equally important, to increase the activity level of all members, it is very important that all roles have some predictability in the outcome of the responsibilities they take on. A proposer relies on Community Advisors (CAs). CAs on Veteran Community Advisors (VCAs) and voters on VCAs. When people trust the dependent role, they are more likely to participate (repeatedly). To fuel the continued development of Project Catalyst, we need to increase the level of trust with a reputation system.\n\nBut a reputation system is not only necessary for Project Catalyst, it's crucial for any decentralized or distributed governance system. Therefore, this challenge is created to support ideas, projects and initiatives that help to develop a valid reputation model that can be used for various use cases to build trust among people and systems.\u00a0\n\n**How success looks like (extended):**\n\n*   For Cardano:\n\nA functional and valid reputation system will accelerate the adaptation of decentralized systems in voting, governance, economy and society. As part of this challenge, proposals are sought that map and build trust and reputation via decentralized systems on the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n*   For Project Catalyst:\n\nActive community members help Cardano grow via Project Catalyst. Entrepreneurs and developers get their proposals funded with the help of trusted (veteran) community advisors and voters. All participants have the feeling of transparency, trust, collaboration, objectivity, community driven decisions, and success.\n\nCardano and Project Catalyst have a maturing governance model that helps growing participants to take the guided path through the process, learn and improve from one fund to the next one. Quick innovations and iterations help the members to contribute and benefit from its growth in parallel. A growing fund combined with growing trust attracts even more entrepreneurs, developers, investors, advisors and voters to the ecosystem and helps all community members to become successful.\n\n**Guiding questions:**\n\n*   How can we be confident in the outcome of a reviewing and/or voting process?\n*   How can we exchange based on trust build by recommendation system?\n*   Do we need to rate each other in order to build trust through reputation?\n*   Who can vote whom up/down and why?\n*   How do we collect and weight ratings?\n*   How can we keep the reputation system effective?\n*   How can we build a transparent reputation system?\n*   How can we create sustainable and accurate expectations of future interactions?\n*   What are the tools that we need to prioritize first?\n*   How can we motivate users to provide feedback?\n*   How can we convince users to provide elicit honest feedback?\n*   How do we avoid fake reputation?\n*   How do we avoid the risk of pooled-reputation (I vote for you, you for me)?\n*   What do our community members want, and how do they get it from the Cardano governance model?\n*   What would make a community member motivated to actively participate in the Catalyst experience?\n\n  \n\n**Potential directions:**\n\n*   Building prototypes for different use cases and industries: eg. in governance/voting, media, research, etc.\u00a0\n*   Definition of 'metrics' for a reputation system\n*   Identify ways to vote to build trust and reputation\n*   Identify ways to comment on 'wrong feedback' and identify fake comments\n*   Qualitative research\n*   Quantitative research\n\n  \n\n**Budget explanation:**\n\nThis challenge supports ideas, projects and initiatives to create various reputation models over the next 6 month.

Strong ecosystems are built on good ideas that are well executed but the ecosystem also relies on impactful community contributors. The future of Catalyst funding could include funding community contributors as well as just ideas.\n\nThe analysis behind how this challenge brief was constructed can be found here and details the tradeoffs of funding types, the decision to use duration and salary caps and how the challenge total requested budget was decided -\u00a0https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors-league/\n\nThe tasks and types of role that would be useful for contributors to perform\u00a0will soon be added to the documentation for the Cardano Contributors League -\u00a0https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors-league/\n\n  \n\n**Contributors league candidate - What should be included in the proposal?**\n\n*   Personal information - Basic personal information such as the candidates name and optionally a profile photo\n*   Professional background - Professional background with skills, education and any relevant information\n*   Contributions - Contributions the candidate has made to the ecosystem so far or wider blockchain community\n*   Budget - Candidates should request their salary expectations for a 6 month time frame. Candidates can request a maximum of $50,000. Candidates should take into account what the market salary rates are for the areas of focus they will be fulfilling and their seniority. E.g. There would be market price difference between a senior and junior developer as well as for different roles such as software developer vs a coordinator. Candidates should provide evidence and justification for your budget where necessary. Candidates should list out any existing funding received from Catalyst and consider this to make any reductions to a final budget requested amount where necessary.\n*   Areas of focus - Detail what parts of the Cardano ecosystem they can help with - Development? Coordination? Events? Catalyst? Scaling? Tools?\n*   Approach to prioritisation and feedback - How will you take feedback from the community and prioritise where you are making contributions?\n\n  \n\n**What is expected from successful candidates?**\n\n*   Support the ecosystem - Contributors should focus on returning the highest value to the ecosystem and look to solve the largest problems the community is facing at the time. Those problem areas could include support for open source SDKs, coordination, missing tooling, governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n*   Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it's needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n*   High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlap and duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it is a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n*   High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n*   Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\n\n  \n\n**What should contributors report?**\n\n*   Progress reports - Contributors should report weekly progress reports on what they are working on in the community, blockers and anything else relevant\n*   KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like idea proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that detail how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n*   Gather community feedback - The contributor should provide a way for the community to provide feedback to what they are working on to help guide changes of focus and priority. The contributor will be the decider of what they work on and can provide justifications for that which would be taken into account for any future funding rounds for being a contributor again.\n\n  \n\n**What sort of candidates are most suitable?**\n\n*   Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n*   Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n*   Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n*   Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn't start with the perfect solution. You understand the difference between short and long term thinking and how to prioritise what is most important and achievable.\n\n  \n\n**What candidates may be less suitable?**\n\n*   Single idea focussed - You have a great idea and want to work on it full time. This candidate is less suitable as contributors should not be tied to a single idea. Instead contributors are a collaborative force that helps pull ideas and teams together. This person can make a proposal for their idea if that's where they want to focus their time where the contributors league could help them instead!\n*   Wants full autonomy and independence - Candidates will need to communicate and collaborate with many community members, ideas and projects regularly. If a candidate wants full autonomy and independence to solve problems then they are more suited to idea focussed proposals rather than joining the contributors league.\n\n  \n\n**Community advisors - How candidates should be assessed**\n\n*   Feasibility - How likely is it that the candidate will be effective in working in the areas of focus they detailed? Do their professional background, skills, experiences and existing contributions support that they will be able to fulfil that role?\n*   Impact - How impactful are the areas of focus that the candidate has listed? Is their chosen area of focus currently lacking contributors? Does that area of focus have hard to find expertise that makes it higher value to the ecosystem?\n*   Auditability - What evidence is given on any of their existing contributions made to the community? Is the approach to prioritisation and feedback given fair and justified? Is there any strong evidence of their existing collaboration and participation in the community?\n\n  \n\n**Challenge team - What duties will support success**\n\n*   Proposal support - Help candidates propose a fair budget and salary expectations for their application. Guide candidates to add more proof of existing contributions or professional background where necessary.\n*   Progress report reviews - Check on execution of reported progress by candidates to ensure it meets the standards and expectations of the community. Flag and report candidates where necessary for wider community review.\n\n  \n\n**Future ideas to consider with this challenge**\n\n*   Reputation building - The contributors league could become a vital part of the Cardano ecosystem where the community could issue credentials or vote on members of the workers league for helping in certain areas.

The network effect will take a hold at some point and when it does, we need to be ready with templates, guides and materials on creating and sustaining a new Cardano Community Hub (CCH).\n2.  **The impact is real and ROI is being met.** Real lives are being affected and improved through this category. This creates a win-win, positive feedback loop as more people benefit from the solutions we offer them, there is even more demand for these services worldwide.\n\n++How is the Fund 8 challenge different?++\n\nWhile the growing demand is showing us that the need is there, our focus for the next challenge should be on the other side of the coin. **Capital supply.**\n\nWhile the facts have proven the necessity of a Community Hubs challenge, there are many other equally as important challenges vying for a position in Fund 8, so we must\u00a0act accordingly. **We must make budget requests that allow others to also pursue their goals** within the ecosystem, both macro, for Catalyst and micro, within the Challenges themselves.\n\nWhile we are **Scaling UP community hubs**, we need to **Scale DOWN individual capital outlay**, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.\n\n1.  Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access.\n2.  Ensuring resilience and self-reliance within that community.\n\nWhen we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location.\n\nIn simpler terms, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it's location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.\n\n**This round will focus much more on 'minimum-viable hubs' (MVHs)**, what is the smallest *effective* unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.\n\n++**Additional Success Metrics:**++\n\n*   Is the hub's Fund 8 proposal in keeping with the MVH principle?\n*   Do they have an understanding of their target audience?\n*   Can they accurately project their reach (physical and online) in the first 3, 6, 12 months?\n*   Can they accurately project the number of onboarded members to the hub in 3, 6, 12 months?\n*   Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?\n*   Have they given an indication of budget costs vs 'cost to launch'? (eg. A CTH may only apply for 1/5 of their cost to launch due to the demand pressures of acquiring catalyst funding)\n\n++**Ratings by CAs and Voters should favour:**++\n\n*   Proposals that have a budget:cost-to-launch ratio between 1-1.5.\n*   Proposals that do not exceed 5% of the total Challenge budget.\n*   Proposals that account for local needs and infrastructure concerns.\n*   Proposals that show creativity and ingenuity around hub design and information delivery.\n*   Proposals that are using local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainability practices.\n\n\\---------------\n\n**Let's build an ecosystem that is truly global**, allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, whatever level they are starting from.\n\nWhen you **drive adoption at the ground level**, you are doing more than just 'building cool products', you are **empowering people to change their lives** in ways they could have never imagined by themselves.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zK5ralU\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/feXUVDF\n\n++Extra reading (where we are going):++\n\n*   Cumbria, UK Business Hub: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sellafield-invests-26m-to-create-cumbria-business-hub\n*   Rwanda Business Hub: https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/norrsken-foundations-hub-opens-in-rwanda-to-house-1000-entrepreneurs-by-next-year\n\n++Past-funded challenges:++\n\n*   Scale-UP Community Hubs (F6):\u00a0\n*   https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Scale-UP-Cardano-s-Community-Hubs/369413-48088\n*   Scale-UP Community Hubs (F5):\u00a0\n*   https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Scale-UP-Cardano-s-Community-Hubs/352534-48088", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Local Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding", "importance": "Without users on the ground level, we are building niche products serving mostly technical people with blockchain expertise."}, {"id": 380986, "category": 26257, "comments_count": 13, "title": "Self-Sovereign Identity", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/380986-48088", "description": "How can we take the next step to support the principles of self-sovereign identity", "author": "rodolfo.miranda", "requested_funds": "400000", "challenge_brief": "Catalyst Project by its Fund 6 and Fund 7 has promoted projects that push adoption of the Decentralized Identity and Atala Prism SDK.

However, growth is a continuous process and this challenge is to keep us united towards our goal: increase the adoption of Cardano in Latin America while giving equal opportunities and inclusion to its people.\n\nAs part of the impact this Challenge already generated, is the creation of the Catalyst LATAM community where many Latin Americans are now gathering, lowering the language barriers and start co-creating our own future thru collaboration.\n\nLatin America is a fertile region for mass adoption and create value based on Cardano. It has talented and passionate people that with the proper tools and opportunities can create its own paths and ways to succeed; failure is an option but not a surrender. What latinos only need, is someone to hold theirs back. That's when Cardano Community and Project Catalyst came into action.\n\nThis challenge is to keep Cardano growing in Latin America, to allow more people to join that wonderful community, and to give a second chance to those that tried but their current living and economic conditions constraints their possibilities to flourish.\n\nWe have an existing Challenge Team that is willing to continue the effort to drive this challenge:\n\nRodolfo Miranda (Argentina), Sebastian Pabon (Colombia), Gustavo Pugliese (Brazil) and Alex Pestchanker (Argentina)\n\nAs a quick onboarding to the Challenge and how to create great proposals for it, we recorded the following video out of a Challenge presentation meetup we did for F7.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXt8AS-okqs", "how_does_success_look_like_": "A wide spectrum of people from Latin America or with connections to Latin America coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.", "importance": "Mass adoption requires a global view.
