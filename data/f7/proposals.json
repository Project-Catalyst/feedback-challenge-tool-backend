    "problem_statement": "How to raise small SPOs and developers in the Cardano community?",
    "url": "https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBraS",
    "requested_funds": "300000",
    "challenge_brief": "Cardano received the \"ghostchain\" nickname by many skeptics, despite the number of SPOs, developers in the Plutus Pioneer Program, community engagement in social media, and several other metrics saying otherwise.\n\n Many in our community embraced the term \"ghost\" in a positive way. Several of these \"ghosts\" are extremely dedicated and talented people, but they need and deserve greater reach and support in the community.\n\n Since Shelley's launch, one of the issues that has created long and fruitless debates has been about the sustainability and the difficulty of small SPOs raise delegation versus large pool groups (like Binance), SPOs with multi-pools (like 1PCT) and SPOs influencers (I won't quote them, but you know who they are). I want to make it clear that this is all in the rules of the game, but it doesn't mean that it is good for decentralization.\n\n We know that the K parameter and pledge are important for defining the theoretical number of SPOs, but marketing capacity and social outreach distort the playing field, harming and overshadowing small SPOs.\n\n How can we level the playing field with sustainable, rational and aove all, free market incentives?\n\n Furthermore, Catalyst has been an amazing funding option for developers in the Cardano community, but the 3-month cycle of each Fund can dampen innovation. Some projects need quick funding sources. Some projects could be funded by the community itself. Not every good proposal fits a challenge. There is demand for alternative funding models for developers and builders, so why not create space for them outside Catalyst regular 3 month cycle funding?\n\n Each team can request up to 20% of the total $300,000 USD budget\n\n E.g.\n\n Team A with 2 proposals of $30,000 USD\n\n Team B with 4 proposals of $15,000 USD\n\n Team C with 1 proposal of $60,000 USD\n\n Team D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $45,000 USD\n\n The idea of limiting a team to requesting up to 25% of the budget is to allow for a greater diversity of ideas and approaches to solving the problem.\n\n It is important to note that 20% is the maximum, any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 5 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\n Due to the urgency of the issue related to the frequent retirement of several small SPOs and the difficulty in increasing the viability/profitability of small SPOs/developers I believe the budget would be appropriate.\n\n Furthermore, at Fund7 we had two challenges funded related to SPOs and there is a good demand for proposals in these challenges..\n\n Potential Directions\n\n * Marketing teams to promote small SPOs\n * Alternative Reward Models (FISO, NFT aidrops)\n * Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms\n * Creating advanced filters for selecting small SPOs\n * Multi delegation research\n * Explorers and adaptation of wallets to build multi delegation portfolios\n\n In this video Sebastien Guillemot( Former co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo and dcSpark CTO and co founder) explains the importance of pools distribution(consensus distribution) to increase reliability and assurances for users and dapps on the blockchain:\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=xwlN3DZvmgQ&feature=emb_logo",

This challenge seeks to foster inclusive and welcoming environments and remove barriers for people from all communities, cultures, and backgrounds to join the Catalyst ecosystem and participate in meaningful ways through a focus on increasing the awareness of and building mechanisms to encourage greater diversity.\n\n This challenge is about human networking, encouraging and fostering communication between groups and individuals, and increasing the diversity in the Catalyst ecosystem through creating safe, welcoming, and exciting spaces for people to feel welcome. There is tremendous value to the entire Catalyst ecosystem in connecting, extending, and growing our human networks and opening up silos to more collaborative engagement.\n\n The value of a network grows exponentially (see: Metcalf's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law)) as more and more connections and nodes are added. Let's grow our human network and bring as many people into our ecosystem as possible. Through increasing diversity and inclusion, this challenge will act as an accelerator for uncovering and fostering creativity and encouraging serendipitous discovery and collaboration by helping people and projects in the ecosystem connect and collaborate.\n\n Investing sufficiently now, to increase diversity in our community will pay off more and more over time as the community grows. The purpose of this challenge is to ensure that we put enough attention on encouraging projects that increase diversity and grow our community to many different parts of the planet and include more and more voices from diverse communities and demographics. It is envisioned that this budget will help support translations and accessibility improvements, bring in initiatives and projects that remove barriers, ease onboarding, and welcome diverse participants.",

    "url": "https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBrWw",
    "requested_funds": "500000",
    "challenge_brief": "The goal with this plan is really to solidify cardano's staying power.\n\n It's hard to tell if someone is a cardano user unless you talk to them about investing. May people get turn off by investing, so most people would not actually learn about cardano until they are an investor because it is still under \"crypto\" to the general public.\n\n I think when cardano is able to introduce more hardware that people will buy and use, then the story will start to change significantly because it's not longer just \"crypto\" and speculation.\n\n For example, There are likely many craftsmen that make awesome knifes in the cardano network. There should be a way for that person to brand their knifes under cardano. In order to brand it under cardano, there needs to be some level of standards to ensure high quality hardware products. Kinda like Michelin Stars for restaurants. We can have levels of quality on hardware that have been verified by the cardano's advisor that focuses on ensuring high quality products.\n\n I think this is also a very important macro trend because one of the biggest issues we have today is that people are buying a lot of cheap and low quality product that does not last. This is not a great use of resource, and it also cost consumers more money over time. People used to old very high-quality products over a very long time, but things have changed since. I think cardano can help make the shift to make people start wanting to own more high quality products.\n\n Personally, I've been designing hardware for the last 6 years now for spacex, and now i really want to start designing things for the open source world so more people can enjoy awesome open source products. Having a way to enable this will take a lot of the hardware engineering resources from centralized hard corporations into the decentralized world. So whatever is designed is no longer own by large companies that takes a large amount of the value, and allow that value get pass back down to the engineer or consumers. I think if we do this right, we can technically build the next NASA/SpaceX if we wanted to.\n\n\n\n I think 500k might be a good budget to start for the next round. It will cost more for R&D because hardware is more expensive.",

This growth is possible because it has been limited to art and collectibles: speculative, not functional, markets, where the idea is mainly all that matters.\n\n If NFTs or some other sort of crypto instrument could securely, verifiably represent real ownership of arbitrary physical goods it would open up the possibility of nearly all commodities markets becoming accessible to blockchain-based trading, while undermining the power and dominance of the entrenched financial institutions that currently control all commodities and securities trades.\n\n But in order for this revolution in decentralization and empowerment to take place, the technology must be created to allow it. A successful system will have to combine considerations of game theory and economics as well as clever development of contracts and trading/minting policies, and perhaps even special purpose (but, preferably, open-source) hardware, in order to answer questions like:\n\n \\-Who is responsible for validating or certifying a token (etc.) that represents a particular good or asset?\n\n \\-Why can they be trusted? What are the incentives?\n\n \\-How can a certified token (etc.) be independently cross-checked? What information must be transparent?\n\n \\-Are there punitive incentives, or just positive? By what mechanism are they imposed?\n\n\n\n Note: alternative working of challenge question: How can physical assets be reliably traded on-chain without relying on privileged authorities to certify the relationship to the asset?",

By supporting and promoting smaller mission focussed SPO's the security of the whole network benefits. Larger hosting providers are also notorious for caring little for their environmental footprint.

As a result of this unconscious movement, traders promote fear and hatred about the founders and institutions of Cardano blockchain, when the price of ADA drops. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no Cardano community in Turkey.\n\n Turkey is full of young people who are enthralled by technology, eager to take on new challenges, and eager to modify their own life in order to improve the country's economic fall down. We must educate them and increase the number of developers and technology enthusiasts in the region to comprehend the true value we seek to provide. In Turkey, we are trying to increase the qualified Cardano community, however, we are just two people active in Project Catalyst. When the real value of the Cardano blockchain is introduced in Turkey, this number will be significantly higher. Given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects, they face language obstacles, lack of competence, and time constraints. Therefore more initiatives are needed to include potential in Turkey to ensure the global adoption\n\n Turkey has great potential in terms of IT staff and cybersecurity.

Many early stage ventures are now launching into the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst wants to fuel many pioneering successes.\n\n More needs to be done to accelerate best of breed Catalyst-funded projects by providing pathways into professional business support, investment, and mentoring programmes.\n\n This is important to Catalyst because great ideas need to be nurtured and small teams need access to timely expertise and tools beyond those that they have in-house.\n\n This challenge seeks professional-grade Accelerator programmes and Business Incubators to step up, co-develop, and deliver venture building programmes with Catalyst. The objective is to help catalyse early successes of Catalyst-funded projects and turn them into highly investable ventures. This helps projects funded by the community to get a fast track to resources and expertise that will help teams build invaluable know-how and strategy by plugging gaps in their current capabilities.\n\n Key to this challenge is the alignment of the proposal to the challenge? And how will success be measured during the scope of the project and beyond?\n\n Proposers should give strong consideration to providing evidence of their experience and history of success and also provide Catalyst voters and reviewers supporting information about the project's operational approach to delivering the objectives previously stated. The more detail the better.\n\n We anticipate that a number of proposals that address this challenge will be funded in Fund 7 and we hope the community takes a portfolio approach to select projects from different parts of the world or a variety of themes relevant to the adoption of Cardano-based projects and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.",

In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.\n\n **++Areas of Focus++**\n\n **Interoperability**\n\n Most digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.\n\n The best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.\n\n We encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.\n\n **Self-governance of Emergent Communities**\n\n ++DAO Governance in Practice++\n\n New legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.\n\n We are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.\n\n The proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.\n\n ++Patterns of Commoning++\n\n We draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from 'Patterns of Commoning.' We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.\n\n How can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?\n\n We are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.\n\n ++Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives++\n\n Many of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.\n\n We need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:\n\n * For onboarding new experts and teachers\n * For people in the community to develop and grow\n * For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.\n\n When reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.\n\n **Circular Supply Chain**\n\n The global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.\n\n Supply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:\n\n * Regenerative agriculture\n * Locally produced art\n * Other forms of local commerce\n\n On the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.\n\n For the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:\n\n ++Small Producer Problem++\n\n How can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?\n\n For example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.\n\n There are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:\n\n * Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains\n * Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.\n\n ++The Last-Mile Problem++\n\n How can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?\n\n This challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We're looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.\n\n An example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.\n\n However, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.\n\n Addressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.\n\n **++A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)++**\n\n **Primitives**\n\n * Digital Identity\n * Verifiable Credential (VC)\n * Verifiable Presentation Request\n * Verifiable Presentation Proof\n * Cryptocurrency\n * Non-fungible token (NFT)\n * Smart contract\n\n **Patterns**\n\n * Trust Registry\n * Governance Framework\n * Token Curated Registry\n * Community member recognition and onboarding process\n * Establishing Individual Reputation\n * Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party\n * Community member as an individual interaction with an external party\n * Community medium of exchange\n * Recognition of external Trust Registry\n * Recognition of external Governance Framework\n * Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party\n\n With that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:\n\n 1. Interoperability between Cardano and Indy anchored DIDs/VCs.\n 2. Self-governance of Emergent Communities\n 3. Circular Supply Chain",

    "url": "https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBrKQ",
    "requested_funds": "150000",
    "challenge_brief": "Since the dawn of time, artists have served an important role in human societies through the re-contextualization of the familiar and deriving new meaning from it. This act of unintuitive meaning-making can expand the mental model of a population and create new avenues for critical analysis of our role in history and the human condition as a whole.\n\n Artists have been indispensable in re-imagining new technologies too. It was artists who for instance, turned the field of optics and light-sensitive materials to the engine of photography and film. Like many STEM fields, the blockchain community has thus far not been welcoming to the insights provided by artists. We do enable a level of independence from traditional king-makers of the art world through NFTs but at the end of the day, NFTs have become a financial product, above all else making artworks easier to speculate on.\n\n We have created a new mode of human communication and organization but have largely handed it to the finance industry; And in doing so, we have alienated a community of creatives who could tell us novel things about this new mode of human connection, further expanding its historical role. It's as if we've invented roads but are only communicating their benefit as a way to make commerce more efficient.\n\n I argue that we urgently need to enable a more ambitious look at artworks USING the blockchain and artworks ABOUT the blockchain. Grants given out by this challenge can serve as an invitation to artists to peel back the curtain on the blockchain as a mode of expression with broad applications.\n\n We need artists to help the public rethink the blockchain as the new roads.\n\n A 150,000 USD grant should be sufficient to empower at least 4 artists to create ambitious installations, sculptures, or interactive artworks using the Cardano blockchain.\n\n \\====\n\n Check out the following references to better connect with the ideas within this challenge brief draft:\n\n \\- Leonardo Journal of Arts and Technology:\n\n https://direct.mit.edu/leon\n\n \\- Representing Theoretical Physics Research in and on Ceramics\n\n https://www.knightwebbgallery.com/artist/nadav-drukker/\n\n \\===\n\n Some examples of art ABOUT technology and art USING technology:\n\n \\- Forklift Ballet: The forklift ballet is an homage to the special relationship between humanity and machinity. The machines should become part of us and enhance our humanity. When they do, they disappear and we see only an extended person. The experience of embodying and using the machine is its own pleasure. In the forklift ballet the dance of the machine is actually the dance of the driver/ballerino. The driver has an intimate relationship with the forklift. The driver has embodied the machine. We see expression come through his extended body. When we embody the pen, or the sword, or the piano, or the computer, or the car, or the forklift we can feel pleasure from using it, allowing its machinity to conduct our feeling.\n\n https://people.ece.ubc.ca/ssfels/pdfs/forklift.pdf\n\n \\- Portals: Portals is a global public art initiative that connects people around the globe through real-time video audiovisual technology housed inside a gold-painted, converted shipping container or other structure. Individuals and groups enter local Portals and engage with individuals or groups in distant Portals through live, full-body video conferencing. The experience has been described as \"breathing the same air.\" Portals are placed in public spaces such as public squares, museums, university campuses, high-level summits, and refugee camps. Participation is free, and the spaces are maintained by staff called Portal_Curators.\n\n https://news.artnet.com/art-world/portals-miami-beach-golden-shipping-container-384461\n\n \\===\n\n An example of an artistic work using the blockchain:\n\n Plantoid: On the face of it, Plantoid looks like a series of plant-like metal sculptures. Each one of these is associated with a unique digital wallet that accepts cryptocurrency (Bitcoin or Ethereum for now), and viewers are encouraged to send digital money to any of the sculptures they find beautiful or evocative. When a predetermined amount of money collects in one of these wallets, a piece of software triggers a process by which a new artist is commissioned to create another metal sculpture that will be part of Plantoid.\n\n https://www.forbes.com/sites/katmustatea/2018/01/31/meet-plantoid-blockchain-art-with-a-life-of-its-own/?sh=2a667e453f64",

Cardano faces potential scaling problems in 2022 as high demand protocols in DeFi, NFTs and gaming begin and continue being released. With alternative scaling solutions not in place there is a risk of overloading demand on the main chain.\n\n **Types of proposals encouraged**\n\n Proposers should consider new novel ideas or research, extensions of Hydra functionality or porting over solutions used in other blockchains that would be suitable for Cardano.\n\n Proposers are welcome to focus on market specific scalability solutions - for instance a solution could focus on DeFi specifically with decentralized exchanges (DEX's) as a focus area or other growing markets that could benefit from novel scaling solutions.\n\n Scalability topic areas:\n\n * Rollups (e.g. zero knowledge rollups, optimistic rollups)\n * Sharding\n * Sidechains\n * State channels\n\n **Size of proposals**\n\n Scaling solutions are inherently complex and require significant engineering effort. As a result proposers should not be discouraged from making proposals that request most of the challenge budget. A single proposal team is both welcome and encouraged to request the entire budget if they can demonstrate an articulated plan with the technical expertise to address the challenge of scaling solutions that are suitable for growing Cardano.\n\n\n\n **Budget rationale**\n\n High technical expertise is needed for scalability solutions. Projects will likely take many months of engineering effort to implement viable solutions.\n\n\n\n **Follow on funding rounds**\n\n If this this challenge setting gets voted in and the proposal(s) submitted show signs they can be impactful then a follow on challenge will be submitted for fund 9 with a larger requested budget to further help the team(s) be able to request further funding.",

The goal is to grow to 100,000 members on IdeaScale by the end of 2021 and certainly well beyond that in 2022 (see April 21, 2021 Town Hall video).\n\n To ensure diversity in our community, these campaigns should be designed to attract entrepreneurs, marketers, developers, visionaries, community managers, community advisors, etc. to eventually increase active participation in Catalyst and increase voter participation.\n\n At best, marketers will propose coordinated campaigns to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their efforts.\n\n **Use of the challenge budget:**\n\n * Online marketing campaigns\n * Event marketing\n\n\n\n **Guiding questions:**\n\n * How can we increase awareness about Project Catalyst?\n * How can we increase the reach of our activities?\n * How can we attract new people to Project Catalyst?\n * How can we accelerate adaption of Cardano?\n\n **Make sure your campaign spendings make sense:**\n\n To reach the right audience with online campaigns, they need to be built carefully. It is very easy to waste money on online ads if a campaign is not built properly. For this reason, proposers should create and provide a detailed media plan of how the campaign is built and how they will reach their target audience to ensure the campaign's success. In addition, proposers should answer the following questions:\n\n * How do they manage their campaigns?\n * Why and how are they using the proposed online channel or platform for their marketing efforts?\n * How do they evaluate their campaigns (metrics, KPIs)?\n * How does the community have access to campaign data?\n\n This challenge aims to give professional and experienced marketers the financial framework to use their skills to increase Catalyst's reach and awareness. Therefore, all proposers are required to submit a detailed media plan and ensure transparency of their activities.\n\n *A media plan is required for all proposers!*\n\n **Requirement for Challenge team:**\n\n To coordinate activities among all proposers a challenge team is recommended. Coordinated activities will increase efficiency and effectiveness of the proposers efforts and will ensure a sustainable use of the treasury funds.",

    "challenge_brief": "For years blockchain has held a promise that has not been properly filled yet. Spot solutions for e.g. traceability, supply chain management, identification and payments have been implemented but large scale benefits of this promising technology are yet to be seen. Based on years of rigorous research and development, Cardano is one of the most serious contenders to fulfill this promise.\n\n Recent and upcoming technological developments in Cardano\u2014smart contracts, Yoroi dApp connector, larger block size (higher throughput), sidechains and state channels, to name a few\u2014are gearing Cardano to be ready for large scale adoption in 2022.\n\n Large corporations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), platform businesses and highly networked startups have very different types of needs. Their industries may vary from finance and high-tech to agriculture and construction and from simple services to knowledge-intensive business. Yet, at the end of the day, they all need modern tools to keep fulfilling their mission, to remain relevant in global competition and to offer their employees the best tools to do what they were hired to do. Any company wants to engage their partners and employees, serve their customers better, improve their processes, cut costs, increase revenues and expand to new business areas.\n\n By removing the middle man and automating processes, smart contract blockchain solutions can drive all of the above. Cardano can at least partly answer to these needs.\n\n **In this challenge, proposed solutions can be tools, services, products, process improvements, data management solutions (CRM, ERP, MES, DMP etc), decentralized cloud solutions, privacy and security related offerings or even metaverse-related solutions.**\n\n In your proposal, it is good to outline the readiness-level of the solution, and whether it is e.g.:\n\n * A Feasibility Study / Proof of Concept / Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano.\n * An existing business-ready product or service that could be converted to run on Cardano.\n * A business-oriented training or consultancy service.\n * An existing blockchain solution brought into the Cardano ecosystem to serve business needs.\n * A prototype or demo in operational environment\n * A creation of model of a system or subsystem\n * A process improvement\n\n When submitting proposals, please include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap as well as short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months. Visualization and video materials are more than welcome to explain often complex business solutions.",

These projects are reaching the point where they are mature enough for people to deploy using them or build tooling for them and so it's time to start welcoming projects to Cardano.\n\n You can hear Charles talk about the importance of this in his video \"The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8a6tX53YPs)",

The largest budget was set for the Developer Ecosystem. In Fund 6 there was a total budget of 4 mil. across all challenges, 1 mil. was assigned to the Developer ecosystem by the Catalyst team.\n\n Fund 7 transfered the majority of the challenge budget over to the community through the Challenge Setting. The Catalyst team proposed the Challenges they defined from F1-F6 in the Challenge Setting Category as part of this transition, along with the Challenges defined by the community. The proposed budget for F7 was 2 mil. but the challenge did not receive enough votes.\n\n In short the Catalyst team has taken the step to hand over responsibility of defining Challenges and allocating budgets. Now it is up to the community to set the priorities of Catalyst. The Catalyst team chose to allocate ~25% to a Developer Ecosystem, which % do we think is right?\n\n This proposal aims to provide a form of continuation of the Developer Ecosystem challenge and its scope, with a stronger emphasis on proposals that directly contribute to collective community resources.\n\n\n\n Note from the proposer:\n\n A challenge with a budget like this should only exist if there is broad support for it. I am putting this up to see if there is such support. In the end this challenge should be 'owned' by the same ecosystem it supports\n\n **\\*\\*\\* | End of Context | \\*\\*\\***\n\n **\\*\\*\\* | Challenge Brief | \\*\\*\\***\n\n This is a draft\n\n Catalyst exists to gradually work towards the final stage of the roadmap of Cardano: Voltaire. We are building tools to support new forms of governance and collaboration, on top of technology which is still being developed. The development of this technology itself, in the end, will have to become part of this same process as well. Such a complex and daunting task requires experts from a variety of disciplines to work together with a common goal.\n\n\n\n **Guiding questions:**\n\n * How can we ensure future efforts benefit from the work that is funded today?\n * How do we align between different open source community efforts?\n * What are the next steps to fuse IOG development with the community?\n * How can we encourage experts to collaborate and share their knowledge and work?\n\n **Possible directions:**\n\n * Education for development in the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystem\n * Developing common tools, core infrastructure or proof of concepts\n * Incentive systems for development & hosting\n * Common audited repositories & overviews of existing solutions\n * Organising events to bring the development ecosystem together\n * Collaborations on Open Standards to improve interoperability within the ecosystem\n\n *Note:*\n\n *Considering the budget there should be some indication of criterias a proposal must meet to request above certain thresholds (for example >100**k must have X team members, at least Y previously funded proposals among them)*",

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community's support and build on or use the Cardano network.\n\n The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\n\n For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\n\n Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let's build upon that.\n\n What this is:\n\n A call to action; Activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\n\n Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\n\n It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with\u2014allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.",

    "url": "https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBqnj",
    "requested_funds": "800000",
    "challenge_brief": ".\n\n **The League of Extraordinary Contributors**\n\n Cardano Contributors League is a community voted for group of funded contributors in the Cardano ecosystem that help to support and drive the ecosystem forward. Contributor roles can include developers, coordinators, communicators, analysts, designers and more or a mixture of different expertise. The contributors can be seen as a glue that helps bring the ecosystem together and maximise collaboration and outcomes within the community.\n\n\n\n **Why is this challenge needed?**\n\n There is a benefit to consider other funding models rather than idea based funding. Strong ecosystems are built on good ideas that are well executed but the ecosystem also relies on impactful community contributors. The future of Catalyst funding could include funding community contributors as well as just ideas.\n\n The analysis behind how this challenge brief was constructed can be found here and details the tradeoffs of funding types, the decision to use duration and salary caps and how the challenge total requested budget was decided - https://cardanopace.notion.site/Cardano-Contributors-League-Analysis-dde51b7ef1094cc0ab1dca5c067d6dcf\n\n\n\n **Contributors league candidate - What should be included in the proposal?**\n\n * Personal information - Basic personal information such as the candidates name and optionally a profile photo\n * Professional background - Professional background with skills, education and any relevant information\n * Contributions - Contributions the candidate has made to the ecosystem so far or wider blockchain community\n * Budget - Candidates should request their salary expectations for a 6 month time frame. Candidates can request a maximum of $50,000. Candidates should take into account what the market salary rates are for the areas of focus they will be fulfilling and their seniority. E.g. There would be market price difference between a senior and junior developer as well as for different roles such as software developer vs a coordinator. Candidates should provide evidence and justification for your budget where necessary. Candidates should list out any existing funding received from Catalyst and consider this to make any reductions to a final budget requested amount where necessary.\n * Areas of focus - Detail what parts of the Cardano ecosystem they can help with - Development? Coordination? Events? Catalyst? Scaling? Tools?\n * Approach to prioritisation and feedback - How will you take feedback from the community and prioritise where you are making contributions?\n\n\n\n **What is expected from successful candidates?**\n\n * Support the ecosystem - Contributors should focus on returning the highest value to the ecosystem and look to solve the largest problems the community is facing at the time. Those problem areas could include support for open source SDKs, coordination, missing tooling, governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n * Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it's needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n * High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlap and duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it is a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n * High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n * Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\n\n\n\n **What should contributors report?**\n\n * Progress reports - Contributors should report weekly progress reports on what they are working on in the community, blockers and anything else relevant\n * KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like idea proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that detail how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n * Gather community feedback - The contributor should provide a way for the community to provide feedback to what they are working on to help guide changes of focus and priority. The contributor will be the decider of what they work on and can provide justifications for that which would be taken into account for any future funding rounds for being a contributor again.\n\n\n\n **What sort of candidates are most suitable?**\n\n * Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n * Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n * Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n * Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn't start with the perfect solution. You understand the difference between short and long term thinking and how to prioritise what is most important and achievable.\n\n\n\n **What candidates may be less suitable?**\n\n * Single idea focussed - You have a great idea and want to work on it full time. This candidate is less suitable as contributors should not be tied to a single idea. Instead contributors are a collaborative force that helps pull ideas and teams together. This person can make a proposal for their idea if that's where they want to focus their time where the contributors league could help them instead!\n * Wants full autonomy and independence - Candidates will need to communicate and collaborate with many community members, ideas and projects regularly. If a candidate wants full autonomy and independence to solve problems then they are more suited to idea focussed proposals rather than joining the contributors league.\n\n\n\n **Community advisors - How candidates should be assessed**\n\n * Feasibility - How likely is it that the candidate will be effective in working in the areas of focus they detailed? Do their professional background, skills, experiences and existing contributions support that they will be able to fulfil that role?\n * Impact - How impactful are the areas of focus that the candidate has listed? Is their chosen area of focus currently lacking contributors? Does that area of focus have hard to find expertise that makes it higher value to the ecosystem?\n * Auditability - What evidence is given on any of their existing contributions made to the community? Is the approach to prioritisation and feedback given fair and justified? Is there any strong evidence of their existing collaboration and participation in the community?\n\n\n\n **Challenge team - What duties will support success**\n\n * Proposal support - Help candidates propose a fair budget and salary expectations for their application. Guide candidates to add more proof of existing contributions or professional background where necessary.\n * Progress report reviews - Check on execution of reported progress by candidates to ensure it meets the standards and expectations of the community. Flag and report candidates where necessary for wider community review.\n\n\n\n **Future ideas to consider with this challenge**\n\n * Reputation building - The contributors league could become a vital part of the Cardano ecosystem where the community could issue credentials or vote on members of the workers league for helping in certain areas. Some examples could be for high impact help in areas such as development, coordination, design, planning.\n * Bonuses - Top contributors league members could be voted for in a governance process and be given a bonus reward for the impact of their contributions. This could make being a contributor very lucrative and align financial incentives well towards those that make large effort contributions that positively benefit the ecosystem.",

    "url": "https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBqkd",
    "requested_funds": "400000",
    "challenge_brief": "The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy \"maximalism\" emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.\n\n There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It's a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other's doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other's achievements or failures.\n\n Cardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let's make this a real super power and let's be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let's create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let's go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us.\n\n **Here are some examples of potential DLT/Blockchain entities, communities and projects to explore and collaborate with:**\n\n **Cosmos**, dubbing itself the Internet of Blockchains, makes it easy for other blockchains to connect to it via their Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). Massive projects like Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Thorchain and Oasis Network are built on the Cosmos SDK.\n\n * https://tendermint.com/sdk\n * https://v1.cosmos.network/intro\n * https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps\n\n **Polkadot** (and its canary network **Kusama**) is a light-weight and quickly updateable design where the Relay Chain offers shared security and cross-chain communication, allowing the connected Parachains to focus on fast deployment of services. Its unique crowdloan mechanism invites the community of token holders to voice out which projects should be implemented first. The Nominated Proof of Stake network offers advanced governance mechanisms as well.\n https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-video-tutorials\n\n Academically impressive and technologically sound **Algorand** has a unique consensus mechanism Pure Proof of Stake and we can learn a lot from their governance model.\n https://www.algorand.com/technology\n\n Boasting a throughput beyond 4,500 tps and near-instant finality, the EVM-compatible **Avalanche** has quickly become the go-to choice for multiple DeFi projects. It has an innovative multi-chain architecture that utilizes both DAG and Blockchain technologies.\n https://www.avax.network/\n\n Another EVM-compatible and blazing fast network is **Fantom**.\n https://fantom.foundation/intro-to-fantom/\n\n **Solana** has a fast-growing ecosystem, a bunch of great developers and massive VC backing.\n https://solana.com/ecosystem\n\n **IOTA** is a DAG geared for the Internet of Things.\n https://www.iota.org/\n\n **Polygon**, started as a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, is also preparing for multi-chain reality.\n https://polygon.technology/get-started/\n\n\n\n **Proposals you can submit to this challenge**\n\n This is an open-ended challenge that welcomes any proposal geared for cross-chain collaboration, co-innovation and interoperability. These can be any community-led projects, initiatives, solutions, tools or services. It could mean for instance:\n\n * New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc)\n * Governance ideas from other chains implemented as part of the Voltaire road map\n * Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano\n * Expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains\n * Oracles and other tools to interpret and interact with cross-chain data\n * Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains and communities\n * Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities (e.g. podcasts, hackathons, webinars, communication hubs, educational resources)\n\n **Challenge Team**\n\n We are seasoned Catalyst community members and \"interoperability maximalists\" who don't believe that any one chain should rule them all.\n\n * Filip Blagojevi\u0107 is an active Project Catalyst member since Fund 2, Plutus Pioneer, Atala Pioneer and Emurgo Academy trainee.\n * Tomi Astikainen is a Veteran Community Advisor who has recently written a book for wannabe crypto investors. He is a Senior Ambassador for Acala/Karura and a driver in the Polkadot/Kusama community in Finland.\n * Felix Weber is an active Project Catalyst member.\n\n **Our assessment of the maturity of this proposed challenge:**\n\n Cardano technology stack is finally mature enough to start inviting proposals for cross-chain collaboration and interoperability. Our proposed challenge is intentionally left open ended and it welcomes a multitude of different solutions. Worthwhile ideas submitted in this challenge should help grow and improve the Cardano and Catalyst community in the near term (next 6-9 months).\n\n This challenge is therefore aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals:\n\n * It helps prepare people to make contributions to the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.\n * It helps turn Cardano into an open source project recognized also beyond our community.\n * It accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer & app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space.\n\n The budget of $400,000 USD is a moderate 2,5% of the total treasury allocation for Fund8. It should be sufficient to kickstart interoperability and cross-chain collaboration initiatives but might not be enough for any large scale infrastructure projects. Therefore, **we encourage submission of \"minimum viable\" and \"proof of concept\" proposals that do include long-term vision and roadmap but which are initially scoped quite small**.",

Implications of change are also considered.\n\n Scenarios are used to map alternative configurations of uncertainties and to highlight decision points.\n\n Informed by the values of the community, a set of criterion can be established by which to evaluate potential scenarios. With clear criterion, one of the scenarios can be constructed to communicate a preferred future around which future action can coalesce. This becomes the model to be implemented, and when backcasted to elicit key stepstones, a roadmap can be developed. Short term projects can be targeted to achieve key milestones.\n\n The process should be iterated periodically in the future, to accommodate changing contexts, new innovations, and potential changes in priority.",

    "challenge_brief": "As well as Africa, I think we should also put significant focus on Cardano within India.\n\n India has a massive population of 1.4 billion.\n\n 55% are under the age of 30yrs (Wikipedia, 2016 est.)\n\n There are a significant percentage of unbanked/rural people\n\n worldpoverty.io notes 100 million Indians (7%) live in extreme poverty\n\n Certain rural areas are already using Aadhaar Pay to pay for goods using their fingerprint (see www.payaadhar.in))\n\n More affluent areas are early adopters of new technologies and India has a lot of skilled IT people\n\n Jio telecoms (3rd largest in the world) has 405 million mobile subscribers (Wikipedia, 2019). So there is enough infrastructure and consumer devices in place to make this a serious market right away.\n\n Having an India focused Catalyst challenge/fund would be very useful to gather teams and ideas and get the Cardano ball rolling in India.\n\n I am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.\n\n On the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.\n\n Emurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to.\n\n IT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding.\n\n\n\n This proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals.\n\n Some suggestions for that Fund8 challenge are:\n\n \\- Setting up local Cardano hubs for regular catch ups (virtual or real world)\n\n \\- Local-language websites/socials/YT set up to attract developers/entrepreneurs to explain Cardano and Catalyst at a high-level\n\n \\- Fund a dapp and create a how-to video in local-language as a walk through to help educate and reduce perceived complexity\n\n \\- Run a competition/pitch-fest for dapp ideas with the top 10 ideas get funded to make a MVP\n\n \\- Connect with universities and training centers\n\n \\- Connect with new and established Indian YouTube channels to talk Cardano tech, dev ideas, business opportunities etc to create a buzz about Catalyst funding\n\n \\- Regularly promote awareness of Cardano and Catalyst funding to bring people into the space eg a 12 month campaign\n\n This is like a big heavy wheel that will take a lot of energy to get turning, but once it starts to move it will (hopefully) keep going with less energy needed.\n\n\n\n How much ADA/USD should be available for this proposal?\n\n Hard to say really, but I put down $1M so that this is taken seriously. $1M goes a long way in India, so a lot of teams could get funding for their projects within Fund8.\n\n If this proposal is successful then I presume the funding would get split into categories for funding eg Indian social media/education, Indian dapp dev, Indian local community/government initiatives etc",

Macro-economic trends and possible outcomes are necessarily obvious at any moment.\n\n Then there are also protocol parameters that are not only technical - but also economic levers that can move the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\n The Cardano economic ecosystem does not live in a vacuum. It is part of a globalized society and these links to \"the real world\" are multiplying and becoming more nuanced.\n\n There is a need for thorough and meticulous work to map the Cardano economic space, its rules, its dangers, threats and opportunities.\n\n Decentralized research into Cardano's economics will provide much needed complementary and/or alternative points of view and will provide a solid basis for future implementation of Cardano's decentralized governance.\n\n In the traditional economy, systems rely on economic forecasts, using them as a guide to plan future operating activities. Better prediction tools and more minds analysing effects of Cardano's economic state-of-affairs will provide greater stability and certainty to the system.\n\n Guiding questions\n\n \u2022 What are the economic tools and analytical insights that we need to prioritize first?\n\n \u2022 Which instruments can be developed to enable a wide array of players to visualize and analyze effects of possible and likely changes that may emerge from inside or outside the system?\n\n \u2022 Can we analyze these issues from multiple points-of-view, including from the points of view of different stakeholders \u2013 and outside players who are impacted by the Cardano blockchain?\n\n \u2022 What is the scope of the new Cardano-economics (Cardanomics) we need in order to be able to identify existing and future economic trends for Cardano?\n\n \u2022 How can we predict the future monetary and economic effects of changes and status quo in the Cardano blockchain?\n\n \u2022 Can models be developed to provide easy yet comprehensive insight into economic effects of planned future developments in the Goguen, Basho, Voltaire eras?
