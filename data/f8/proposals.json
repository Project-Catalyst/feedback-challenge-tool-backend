And, of course, Ada holders will be the one who pays for expert's works (CA/vCA's reviews). Cheating and/or poor review will soon die down, as a consequence.</p><p>- For proposers, in order to receive votes from Ada holders, their project itself must be excellent and well approaches Ada holders.

To a newcomer, it can be confusing. To those who stay, it's still confusing. How might we make Catalyst a safe and welcoming place for all kinds of people?</p><p><br></p><p>In the world of business, there\u2019s a saying \u2018Great employee experience leads to great customer experience\u2019. More than just financial rewards, people long for a sense of mastery, autonomy and purpose (see e.g. Daniel Pink: \"<a href=\"https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Drive</a>\").</p><p><br></p><p>\"People who see the world differently and have diverse ideas and perspectives often bring creativity and innovation to an organization.

If people don\u2019t feel included, trusted and heard, they will either leave or remain lurkers forever. Culture needs to be built into the core of the organization and it needs to be nurtured over time via initiatives that encourage constructive sharing of ideas.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>There are many lenses, or paradigms, through which one can view diversity:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Demand for diversity, coming from outside of the monocultural core group, is viewed as a threat to the perceived unity or a \u2018non-issue\u2019, something that is not important enough to even discuss. People feel safer working with similar colleagues so any attempts to increase diversity are stifled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Non-discrimination:</strong> Also referred to as \u2018Color-Blindness\u2019 or meritocracy, this paradigm focuses on equal employment opportunities but without acknowledging potential differences due to different backgrounds. The thinking goes: \u201cPeople should be treated equally no matter where they are from; cultural background does not count and does not need to be specifically dealt with.\u201d Thinking \u2018we are all the same\u2019 aims to assimilate and hide diversity; important differences are not valued.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fairness:</strong> In this paradigm, diversity is seen as a matter of equal opportunity and fair treatment. An organization addresses the need for specific support for minority groups, reducing social inequalities. While the concern for fairness is genuine, this is good for the organization\u2019s image and helps recruitment, while guaranteeing compliance with legal and social requirements. People operating from this standpoint may have good intentions but fall short in truly utilizing diversity for the organization\u2019s and its members' full benefit. Preserving harmony may stifle creative dissent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Access and legitimacy:</strong> In this paradigm, differences are celebrated but only because they make business sense. The thinking goes that for the organization to be relevant, it needs to portray the same diversity as the global society it operates in. The danger of this approach is that monoculture remains the norm and \u201dthe diverse\u201d are kept on the sidelines. People may feel exploited if they find out that they are there just to make the organization look diverse.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learning and growth:</strong> This final paradigm also promotes equal opportunity, acknowledges differences and values them but it doesn\u2019t assimilate everyone into one mold or form silos and pockets of diversity. Instead, it connects people with diverse traits, backgrounds, knowledge and skills. Listening is encouraged and differences are internalized so that the organization can learn and grow because of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The benefits of adopting the learning and growth paradigm are clear:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>It brings new ideas and different knowledge for everyone\u2019s use.</li><li>It helps us to develop new skills and approaches to the work we do.</li><li>It helps us become more innovative as individuals, as teams and as a whole organization.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>When culture of inclusion becomes a collective strength, it helps align strategies with people\u2019s diverse capabilities. However, it takes time and needs to be enabled through a consciously built culture that encourages trust and belonging.</p><p><br></p><p>In this kind of culture, everyone feels at ease, no matter how heated the daily discussions get. In a truly effective innovation platform, it is not only okay to voice out differing opinions; it is expected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>An ideal Catalyst Culture:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Is fun, relaxed and welcoming.</li><li>Communicates that diversity of background, opinion and insight are essential.</li><li>Creates an expectation of high standards of performance from everyone.</li><li>Stimulates personal development and emotional intelligence.</li><li>Promotes peer mentoring and learning from one another.</li><li>Encourages openness, trust, asking, listening and a sense of belonging.</li><li>Makes people feel heard, respected and valued.</li><li>Breathes life into a well-articulated and widely understood mission.</li><li>Supports and maintains an egalitarian and non-bureaucratic structure.</li><li>Allows a degree of creative friction for innovation to flourish.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Examples of proposals you could submit to this challenge:</strong></p><ul><li>Educational events to explore the related concepts and research</li><li>Discussion fora to help us understand each other and to work better together</li><li>Use of software to make meeting culture more inclusive (e.g. <a href=\"https://otter.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Otter</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.equalicert.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Equalicert</a>)</li><li>Analysis tools to understand how culture influences Catalyst members' thoughts and behaviour.</li><li>Social media content creation to help raise awareness</li><li>Tools that help in recruitment and onboarding of top talent</li><li>Incentives for bringing different types of people together in teams</li><li>Surveys, interviews and documentation of \"the Catalyst pulse\"</li><li>Systems and processes that strengthen inclusiveness in Catalyst</li><li>Partnerships with external expert organizations</li><li>Initiatives to clarify our shared mission, vision, values and goals</li><li>Competence development tools and frameworks</li><li>Mentoring, coaching and peer support structures and solutions</li><li>Wellbeing and community listening related initiatives</li><li>Celebrations, rites, rituals and other cultural artefacts to strengthen the culture</li><li>Leadership development initiatives</li><li>Equal participation and engagement initiatives</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It is up to all of us to propose initiatives that help strengthen the most important asset Cardano has: the community.

This leads to a segmentation of the population that has proper financial means, and limits the capabilities of consumers and small businesses.\n*   Natural Disasters Response: El Salvador is subject to a number of environmental risks, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and flooding, which tend to take a toll on the population.\n*   Education: Like many countries in Latin America, El Salvador is subject to low standards and unequal access to education.\n    *   Elementary Education: The average dropout rate of schools is high across the country, and only a few percent of people manage to make it to university, which spoils the professional and productive capabilities of the country.\n    *   Technical Education: There\u2019s a lack of availability and affordability for technical education.

In particular, the shortage of development funds and engineers is serious, and students have few opportunities to get these resources. However, Catalysts are easier to raise money than VCs(Venture Capital) and Business Contests, and also can connect globally with engineers in this community. However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students. In addition, it is difficult to set a clear Roadmap while resources are scarce and to get a high evaluation from CA(Community Advisor).\n\nTherefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of $ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst. In continued participation in Catalyst, funding experience, even on a small scale, is evaluated by the community. Therefore, it is important to set a budget limit.\n\nThe Category Goal is to encourage engineers to scout students who are evaluated by the community and create a new team to join the next Fund with a clear Roadmap. This is a benefit for both students and engineers to raise a large salary for engineers through Catalyst rather than from VCs or Banks.\n\n**Team & Relevant experience**\n\n\u30fbIssa Ichikawa (Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cardano_ISSA)\n\n21-year-old/Junior at Waseda University in Japan/Student entrepreneur/Catalyst Fund6 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)\n\n\u30fbYUTA\u00a0(Twitter: https://twitter.com/yuta_cryptox)\n\nCardano Ambassador/SPO/Japan representative of Eastern Town Hall Meeting/Catalyst Fund2,6,7 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)", "how_does_success_look_like_": "By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers.", "importance": "Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment."}, {"id": 399693, "category": 26455, "comments_count": 1, "title": "DAOs <3 Cardano", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/399693-48088", "description": "<p>How can we make Cardano the go-to choice for building DAOs?

Limitless options!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>3) Use of a single sign on to allow users to access features in both apps.</em></strong></p><p>There should be no need to hold multiple passwords or to login to different apps. It might be obvious where the boundary of a system is due to interface changes, but it should work as seamlessly as using a single app.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Stretch goals to stand out and impress voters:</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>1) Make use of Atala Prism as part of the single sign-on solution to handle user credentials.</p><p>1a) Allow place based participation credentials for non-governmental organisations.</p><p>1b) Support electoral constituency credentials for government institutions or organisations related to government administration areas.</p><p><br></p><p>2) Formally collaborate and pair up with other proposal submitters to extend the range of applications that are integrated rather than duplicating applications. The perfect results would be 4 or more proposal teams delivering a suite of 8+ applications using 1 single sign on solution.</p><p><br></p><p>3) Use of distributed storage and compute for hosting apps such as internetcomputer.org, IPFS, nunet.io, threefold.io etc. (There is an F8 proposal for a Cardano Decentralised Storage solution).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Requirement 2 - Community Onboarding</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There have been many attempts at digital democracy apps in the past but none has really managed to inspire the population at large and gained significant use.</p><p><br></p><p>Proposers should bring in at least 2 distinct organisations as test participants. This is to ensure the integrated tool set gets real world feed back as part of a Beta Test / User Acceptance Test. Each organisation could be a small not-for-profit, an online community such as Catalyst, or even a large cooperative if there's a valid use case for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Proposers can decide if they want to incentivise this participation by including in their proposal an ADA grant to not-for-profit organisations for use of their time. They should also ensure compliance with any local tax or crypto legislation.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting new democratically oriented organisations onboarded and versed in multi-signature wallet use and decentralised technology should be seen favourably by voters, so the size and reach of organisations should be assessed when voting on proposals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Stretch goals: </em></strong></p><p>1) Recruit partner organisations across multiple continents instead of 1 country to be able to test with groups from different cultures and languages.</p><p><br></p><p>2) Again formal collaboration and pairing up with other proposal submitters would allow a wider user community to be involved in evaluating the range of applications that are integrated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Requirement 3 - Cost Constraints.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Instead of developing new apps and dApps this challenge is focused on integration by using existing solutions. To add a layer of difficulty the challenge fund budget will be limited to $150,000 and the maximum proposal size will be limited to $37,500 to get a minimum of 4 integrations.

We are aiming to involve more team members and upgrade the proposal based on the assessments.\n\nTurkey is a bridge between Asia and Europe including increased connection with countries in Africa. It has a large and young population of more than 80M people. It is the home of one of the earliest cryptocurrency exchanges, BTCTurk, which was founded in 2013. As such, Turkish people have been some of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Triple-A research, ~2.4M of the populace own cryptocurrencies. This makes it the nation with the 19th most cryptocurrency users \\[1\\]. This however does not capture the entire picture as the growth of this number has been 10 fold in the past year \\[2\\]. This massive growth can most directly be attributed to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies and to the speedy devaluation of the Turkish Lira (around ~40% against the US Dollar in 2021).\n\nDevaluation of the currency has gotten exceedingly worse and is set to continue in the near future. The negative effects are felt throughout the country as wages tumble on a USD basis. The minimum wage is around $220 as of the time of this proposal (nearly half the working population earn min. wage), meaning any funds put to work in Turkey can get lots of involvement from the local population.\n\nDespite this growth, Cardano adoption is very low. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no broader Cardano community. The majority of the investors in the trading group were drawn to ADA by the performance of the cryptocurrency. As a result, trader emotions like fear and greed dominate the conversation within cryptocurrency communities, resulting in misinformation about the broader Cardano community. As such, a Turkish Cardano community is sorely needed to raise awareness of the vision of Cardano beyond the token price.\n\nWe the proposers of this challenge are trying to do so and bring more qualified Turkish people into the Cardano community. However, we are just a group of three within Project Catalyst with a broader network of around 20 that are involved in cryptocurrencies in Turkey. If the real value of Cardano can be demonstrated in Turkey, this number will dramatically increase. This is especially true given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects. However, they face language obstacles and lack some of the relevant competencies. Therefore more initiatives are needed to realize the potential of Turkey and to aid the global adoption of Cardano.\n\nGiven these points, what could Turkey offer the Cardano community back in return? Turkey has great potential in its qualified IT and cybersecurity personnel built thanks in part to a solid financial services sector. It also has a large pool of young, active and forward looking individuals, looking to contribute to their communities. This challenge aims to bring this potential to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nGuiding questions\n\nHow can we involve general ADA holders in project Catalyst in Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase the number of SPOs from Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase more meaningful participation from Turkey?\n\nHow can we encourage new members to utilize the tools and services available for onboarding?\n\nHow can we localize the existing materials?\n\nChallange Team\n\nCem Karaca\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca\n\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ya\u015far Akyar\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar\n\n\u00c7a\u011fkan Acarbay\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fkan-acarbay-b2210b136\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-turkey/.\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/paribu-has-published-the-results-of-the-most-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-survey-cryptocurrency-use-in-turkey-has-increased-by-10-times", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Motivated community of developers, SPOs, stakers, voters, challenge teams collaborating for the growth of Cardano from Turkey in 2023.", "importance": "The decentralisation and resilience of Cardano are based on the inclusion of different locations including those communities not involved."}, {"id": 398526, "category": 26455, "comments_count": 2, "title": "Great Impact, Great Funding", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/398526-48088", "description": "How can we implement big impact projects that improve Cardano\u2019s scalability, interoperability, decentralization or security?", "tags": [], "author": "vladimirp", "requested_funds": "1200000", "challenge_brief": "This challenge is designed to provide a large budget for larger projects that can research and then deliver finalized products in a mid-term time horizon (up to 12 months) while also providing regular updates to the community along the way.\n\nSome specific guidelines are introduced, for the submission of a proposal in this challenge:\n\nThe budget for a single proposal should not be below $200,000\n\nProposals should be for complete projects, with published solutions and/or deployable or usable by end users on delivery\n\nThe delivery should take place within 12 months from start of funding\n\nAs part of the proposal submission, the team must explain the expected beneficial impact of the project on the Cardano system in detail so that the proposal\u2019s expected impact can be fully assessed\n\nThe proposing team must provide one or more ways of keeping the Cardano community (In addition to the Challenge Team) updated on progress during project implementation at least on a monthly basis with a focus on transparency\n\nThe proposing team must provide detailed references for the team and the individual members working on the proposal - thus proving relevant experience with the subject matter and that they are capable of delivering the solution\n\n\n\n**Guiding questions for proposers**\n\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of scalability?\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of interoperability?\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of decentralization?\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of security?\n*   What are the best infrastructure solutions used on other ecosystems that could serve as inspiration for Cardano?\n\nWhat are the bottlenecks that are already looming on the horizon that could stifle Cardano\u2019s growth and need to be resolved and why are they urgent?\n\nMore ambitious projects with greater impact should compete for larger funding under this challenge if they can prove their proposal will have a large impact and the team has competency in the topic.\n\nThis challenge invites proposers to apply for funding for projects that tackle core issues affecting Cardano\u2019s present and future, such as scalability, interoperability, decentralization.\n\nThe precise theme of the proposed project is free, but should comply with the challenge brief.", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Quality projects will increase performance and utility of Cardano over a longer horizon.

Further innovation will be needed as governments, companies and new, digital-only organizations work to build trusted digital monetary systems, offer new data monetization propositions and conduct lending, payments, real estate investment and more in the metaverse. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) \u2014 with voluntarily agreed-upon rules enforced by a computer program that runs on a blockchain \u2014 will likely play important roles.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p><p>A true metaverse requires seamless interoperability among users and platforms, based on web 3.0 and still-to-be-determined standards. While this interoperability will offer new possibilities to reach and understand customers, it will also raise new challenges for gathering and protecting data, and for cybersecurity and privacy. It may also undermine business strategies built around keeping users and their data in a given platform. Competitive advantage may shift to those companies that offer (through hardware or software) trusted ways for users to enter the metaverse.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Governance</strong></p><p>The metaverse will need rules of engagement for users, rules for how the metaverse itself can change over time and enforcement mechanisms, including for tax collection, data governance and regulatory compliance. Early movers may be able to help set these rules. Security will be paramount, as a new, decentralized digital world may offer malicious actors a new world of entry points for attack. Authenticity \u2014 and trust more broadly \u2014 should also be front and center, to reduce the disinformation that has often plagued the internet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Identity</strong></p><p>In the internet today, identity is often linked to platforms. It may be true, pseudonymous or anonymous. The metaverse, decentralized and interconnected, will need trusted digital identities \u2014 for people, assets and organizations \u2014 that port across platforms. Companies active in digital identity now may both help set the metaverse\u2019s standards and be able to offer a necessary service. Digital identities may also be central to permitted data collection and data governance in a decentralized environment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experience</strong></p><p>A shared, persistent and immersive 3D digital world will offer unique experiences, based on its own aesthetics \u2014 beliefs, ideals and tastes as expressed in individual choices. Some trends for user experience are already becoming clear, in games and VR / AR environments. Companies that create trusted metaverse experiences and protect privacy rights may win consumer loyalty, while those that stay on top of metaverse trends may be well placed to forecast consumer preferences and behavior.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Persistence</strong></p><p>A true metaverse should reflect in real time the changes made in it by different participants, entering and leaving it in different ways, in different places, at different times. When you take your metaverse headset off, the metaverse and other participants will continue their activities uninterrupted, with (for example) smart contracts enforcing agreements and trading assets. This persistence will likely require a new approach to digital assets and activities, including services and applications that are portable, dynamically configurable and extensible.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/emerging-tech/demystifying-the-metaverse.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Demystifying the Metaverse</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Alignment with Fund9 strategic goals</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Fund9 Challenge Setting proposals have to meet one or more of these attributes:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><ul><li><em>Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.</em></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Because it's so trendy, a metaverse-related challenge can help bring people from outside of Cardano ecosystem into Catalyst.</li><li><em>Turn Cardano into an open source project.</em></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">The centralized metaverse model advanced by large corporations is a threat to all things open source.

This situation has already led to community members reducing their involvement with Catalyst or turning their backs on Cardano altogether.\n\n\n\nThe key question then is how do we end something destructive and build something desired.\n\n\n\nWhile the purpose is to promote constructive change processes that may offer immediate solutions, the focus is on building strong relationships within and outside of the Cardano community.\n\n\n\nConflict transformation borrows from indigenous peacemaking, civil rights, and non-violent resistance movements. It influenced restorative justice and is also the base for alternative dispute resolution processes such as narrative and transformative mediation.\n\n\n\n**Potential directions**\n\n\n\n*   Training of conflict transformation specialists (e.g. mediators, facilitators)\n*   Building and expanding conflict transformation services on Cardano\n*   Conflict transformation treasury to utilize services at no cost to disputing parties within the Cardano community\n\n\n\n**About the proposers**\n\n\n\nMatthias Sieber - B.A. Negotiation, Conflict Resolution, and Peace-building, Master of Dispute Resolution, Graduate Certificate in Alternative Dispute Resolution, DRPA-certified mediator, Catalyst Circle v2 member, Cardano StackExchange moderator, Cardano Ambassador, CEO Loxe Inc.\n\n\n\nVictor Corcino - MSc in software development applied to engineering, Specialization in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Catalyst Circle v1 member, Leader of Catalyst School, Co-founder of Catalyst Swarm and Cardano AIM, COO Loxe Inc.\n\n\n\nNori Nishigaya - Founder of the Salmon Nation Decentralized Alliance (SANADA), Bridge Builders, and SPO \\[SAMON\\].
